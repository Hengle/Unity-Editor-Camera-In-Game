# Unity Editor Camera In Game

There's not much to say about this project, it uses Cinemachine and some simple
code to recreate the Unity Editor Camera in game, it doesn't currently contain 
all the functionality of the Unity Camera : You can't click on objects...etc

Functionality Contained:

- Simple Horizontal and Vertical movement.
- UpDown movement.
- Right click to look around.
